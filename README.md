# maze

Demo: http://www.augustoclaro.com.br/maze-game/

Maze game, featuring random maze generation and maze solver. Eventually, I'll write neural networks on top of it. Initial tries are on `neural-network` branch.

Using Phaser-CE + TypeScript.

Run instructions:
Clone repository, `npm install` packages, and run with `npm start`

Path finder can be enabled/disbaled and maze size can be changed through controls in demo page.
